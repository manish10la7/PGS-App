## 1. Initial State
- The login screen used a dummy check for email and password.
- No real authentication was implemented.

## 2. Firebase Auth Setup Attempt
- Tried to use `firebase/auth` from the Firebase JS SDK for authentication.
- Encountered the error: `Unable to resolve "firebase/auth"` in Expo Go.
- This is because Expo Go does not support native Firebase modules out of the box.

## 3. Firebase SDK Installation
- Installed the `firebase` npm package to try to resolve the import error.
- However, Expo Go still does not support `firebase/auth` as it requires native code.

## 4. google-services.json
- Added `google-services.json` to the project for Android native Firebase support.
- Realized that Expo managed workflow does not use this file unless building a standalone app with EAS Build.

## 5. Switched to Firebase REST API
- Replaced the `firebase/auth` logic with a call to the Firebase REST API for email/password login.
- This works in Expo Go and does not require native modules.

## 6. Google Sign-In Implementation
- Installed `expo-auth-session` to support Google Sign-In in Expo Go.
- Used the Google OAuth client ID from `google-services.json`.
- Implemented Google Sign-In using `expo-auth-session/providers/google`.
- The Google button now launches the Google login flow and calls `onLoginSuccess` on success.

## 7. Final State
- Email/password login works using the Firebase REST API.
- Google Sign-In works using Expo Auth Session.
- The app is compatible with Expo Go and can be built as a standalone app for full native support if needed.

**If you want to use more advanced Firebase features (push notifications, etc.), you will need to build a custom dev client or eject to bare React Native.**
